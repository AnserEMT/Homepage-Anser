# AnserEMT-Homepage

The [Anser EMT System](https://anser.io/#/) is an open-source electromagnetic tracking system developed at University College Cork in collaboration with IHU Strasbourg.

The aim of the Anser project is to provide an open-source implementation for electromagnetic tracking with particular application to image-guided interventions. The system is compatible with commercially available EMT sensors as well as the Open Network Interface for Image-Guided Therapy (OpenIGTLink) for easy communication with visualisation toolkits such as CustusX, MITK and 3D Slicer.

Also check out **OpenEMT Intiative** at [OpenEMT.org](https://openemt.org/index.php?title=OpenEMT.org), the open source community for electromagnetic tracking systems.
